The best time for steering document creation in a Kiro spec-driven project depends on what type of steering guidance you need:

## Best Times to Create Steering Documents

**During Requirements Phase:**
- Create steering docs for **project standards and conventions** (coding style, naming conventions, architecture patterns)
- Add **domain-specific knowledge** that will inform requirements gathering
- Include **regulatory or compliance requirements** that must be considered from the start

**During Design Phase:**
- Add **technical constraints and preferences** (preferred libraries, frameworks, deployment targets)
- Include **integration requirements** with existing systems
- Document **performance and scalability requirements** that will shape the design

**During Implementation:**
- Create **implementation-specific guidance** as patterns emerge
- Add **debugging and troubleshooting knowledge** discovered during development
- Include **testing strategies and tools** that prove effective

## Key Principle: Just-in-Time Creation

The best approach is to create steering documents **when you first encounter the need for that guidance**. This ensures:
- The guidance is relevant and actionable
- You don't over-engineer documentation for hypothetical needs
- The steering content reflects real project constraints and learnings

## Practical Recommendation

Start with **minimal steering** during requirements/design phases (basic standards and constraints), then **expand incrementally** as you learn what guidance would have been helpful earlier in the process.
